# Deep-HOSeq -- ICDM 2020
Codes for Deep-HOSeq: Deep Higher-Order Sequence Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis --- ICDM 2020 



### Dependencies / Notes
Deep-HOSeq is written in python3 with some code fragments copied from DCGAN implementation from Carpedm20.
  - The code is developed with Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.12.0 (with GPU support) on Linux
  - For reasons of my convenience, `data_dir` is required to be `data_dir = ../../data` -- errors might pop-up when other directories are used.
  - To train the model please execute main_DeepHOSeq.py
